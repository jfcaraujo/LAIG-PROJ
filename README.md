# LAIG-PROJ

This was made for a class assigment of LAIG, it contains the assigment at 2 different times.

The original assigment was a xml parser to create a scene (a group of objects) using WebCGF.

The T2 folder corresponds to the second part of the assigment, it not only includes the parser but it also added animations and a security camera.

The T3 folder corresponds to the third part, it removes the security camera but instead add the ability to play game running on sictus.

Intructions to run the project are on the Users manual word file
